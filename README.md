# AdMob Apps

Google AdMob provides a way for you to earn more money by matching ads to your app based on the criteria you set. The ads are created and paid for by advertisers who want to promote their products and will pay different prices for different ads.

Here's how it works:

You create ad space in your app. You make your app ad spaces available by creating ad units in AdMob. You choose where you want the ads to appear when you add the ad units to your app code. Ads can be displayed in a number of formats and are seamlessly added to built-in UI components.
We show the highest performing ads to your users. AdMob works with its own network and third-party ad networks to ensure the highest performing ads will be shown in your app.
You get paid. We handle all the behind-the-scenes work of billing advertisers and networks for the ads shown in your app.
Before you can display ads in your app, you'll need to create an AdMob account. Then, select one of the following platforms to get started with our SDK.
